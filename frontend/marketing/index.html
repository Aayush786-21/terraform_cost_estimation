            <div class="problem-content">
                <p>
                    You're designing new infrastructure. You're choosing regions, instance sizes, and services. 
                    You're making decisions that will affect your monthly cloud bill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you don't know what those decisions will cost until after you deploy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So you guess. You build spreadsheets. You hope. And sometimes, you're surprised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the bill arrives, it's too late to change course. The infrastructure is running. 
                    The team has committed. The conversation becomes reactive: "Why is this so expensive?" 
                    "Can we reduce this?" "What if we had chosen differently?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    These conversations are harder when they happen after deployment. They're harder when 
                    you're explaining surprises instead of making informed choices.
