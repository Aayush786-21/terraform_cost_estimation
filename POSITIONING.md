# Product Positioning

## STEP 1 — CATEGORY

**Category Name:** Pre-bill cloud cost clarity

**Why existing categories are insufficient:**
- **Cost optimization tools** focus on reducing existing spend (after deployment)
- **Cloud billing dashboards** track actual usage (after deployment)
- **Cost management platforms** assume infrastructure is already running

**What's new:** This category focuses on understanding costs *before* infrastructure exists, during design and planning phases, when decisions can still be changed.

---

## STEP 2 — CORE PROBLEM (SINGULAR)

**Teams struggle to have honest cost conversations before infrastructure is deployed.**

The emotional core: Uncertainty, anxiety about budget surprises, and the inability to answer "Can we afford this?" until it's too late to change course.

---

## STEP 3 — PRIMARY USER (ICP v1)

**Primary User:** Infrastructure engineers and architects who are designing new infrastructure or making significant changes, and need to understand cost implications before deployment—without the pressure of optimization or the complexity of actual billing data.

**Context of use:**
- Designing new infrastructure from Terraform
- Evaluating architecture changes
- Preparing cost estimates for stakeholders
- Comparing design alternatives

**Trigger moment:** "I need to know what this will cost before I commit to deploying it."

---

## STEP 4 — UNIQUE VALUE (ONE SENTENCE)

**This helps you understand what your infrastructure will cost before you deploy it, so you can make informed decisions and have honest conversations with your team.**

**Why it's different:**
- Shows costs *before* deployment (not after)
- Preserves assumptions and uncertainty (not false precision)
- Enables scenario exploration (not optimization)
- Grounds insights in real data (not generic advice)

---

## STEP 5 — WHAT THIS IS NOT

**Explicit non-goals:**

1. **Not a cloud provider bill** — These are estimates based on assumptions, not actual usage
2. **Not a cost optimization engine** — We don't recommend changes or calculate savings
3. **Not a finance dashboard** — We don't track spending or enforce budgets
4. **Not real-time usage tracking** — We estimate from configuration, not monitor actual resources
5. **Not an enforcement tool** — We don't block deployments or set spending limits
6. **Not a billing reconciliation tool** — We don't compare estimates to actual bills

**Why this matters:** Being explicit about what we're not protects trust and sets correct expectations.

---

## STEP 6 — COMPETITIVE FRAMING

**Why existing solutions exist:**

- **AWS Cost Explorer / CloudWatch Billing** — Track actual spending after resources are running
- **Infracost** — Estimate costs from Terraform, but optimized for CI/CD and cost reduction
- **Spreadsheets** — Manual cost modeling, but time-consuming and error-prone
- **Cloud provider pricing calculators** — Manual, resource-by-resource, no scenario comparison

**Why this product exists:**

None of those solve the need for **honest, assumption-aware cost conversations during design**, when you can still change course, without the pressure of optimization or the complexity of actual billing data.

**Key differentiator:** We're built for *understanding* and *conversation*, not *optimization* or *tracking*.

## STEP 7 — POSITIONING SUMMARY

### Category
**Pre-bill cloud cost clarity**

### One-Sentence Positioning Statement
**This helps you understand what your infrastructure will cost before you deploy it, so you can make informed decisions and have honest conversations with your team.**

### Primary User
**Infrastructure engineers and architects** designing new infrastructure or making significant changes, who need to understand cost implications before deployment—without optimization pressure or billing complexity.

### Core Value (3 Bullets)
- **See costs before deployment** — Understand cost implications during design, when decisions can still be changed
- **Honest assumptions** — Every estimate shows its assumptions and confidence level, so you know what's certain and what's not
- **Explore scenarios safely** — Compare design alternatives side-by-side without pressure to optimize or commit

### Explicit Non-Goals (3 Bullets)
- **Not a cloud provider bill** — Estimates based on assumptions, not actual usage
- **Not a cost optimization engine** — We don't recommend changes or calculate savings
- **Not a finance dashboard** — We don't track spending or enforce budgets

---

## TONE & VOICE

**Calm** — No urgency, no fear-based messaging, no pressure to act  
**Clear** — Plain language, no jargon, no marketing speak  
**Confident** — We know what we are and what we're not  
**Non-salesy** — Focus on understanding, not conversion

---

## USAGE GUIDELINES

This positioning should be used for:
- Landing page copy
- Demo narrative
- Product messaging
- Early user conversations
- Marketing materials

**Key principle:** Lead with understanding, not optimization. Lead with honesty, not precision. Lead with conversation, not action.
