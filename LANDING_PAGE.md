## SECTION 1 — HERO (The One-Sentence Truth)

### Headline Options

**Option 1 (Direct):**
```
Understand what your infrastructure will cost — before you deploy it.
```

**Option 2 (Problem-focused):**
```
Cloud cost shouldn't be a surprise you discover after shipping.
```

**Option 3 (Action-oriented):**
```
See your infrastructure costs during design, not after deployment.
```

**Recommended:** Option 1 — Most direct and clear.

---

### Subheadline

```
Get honest cost estimates from your Terraform configuration, 
with assumptions and uncertainty clearly shown. 
Explore scenarios, share with your team, and make informed decisions 
before infrastructure is deployed.
```

**Alternative (shorter):**
```
Cost estimates from Terraform, with assumptions shown. 
Explore scenarios safely. Share with your team. 
Make decisions before deployment.
```

### Primary CTA

```

**Option 2 (Action-oriented):**

```

**Option 3 (Invitation):**

```

**Recommended:** Option 1 — Least pressure, most curiosity.

### Tagline (Optional, for footer or meta)

```
Pre-bill cloud cost clarity
```

## SECTION 2 — THE PROBLEM (Recognition)

### Headline
```
The cost conversation happens too late
```

### Content

You're designing new infrastructure. You're choosing regions, instance sizes, and services. You're making decisions that will affect your monthly cloud bill.

But you don't know what those decisions will cost until after you deploy.

So you guess. You build spreadsheets. You hope. And sometimes, you're surprised.

When the bill arrives, it's too late to change course. The infrastructure is running. The team has committed. The conversation becomes reactive: "Why is this so expensive?" "Can we reduce this?" "What if we had chosen differently?"

These conversations are harder when they happen after deployment. They're harder when you're explaining surprises instead of making informed choices.

**Cloud cost shouldn't be a surprise you discover after shipping.**

---

## SECTION 3 — THE SHIFT (Before vs After)

### Headline
```
A different approach: cost clarity during design
```

### Content

**Before:**

Cost is unclear until deployment. You make decisions with incomplete information. Conversations about budget happen reactively, after infrastructure is running. Assumptions are hidden or forgotten. You discover costs when it's too late to change course.

**After:**

Cost is visible during design. You make decisions with cost implications in mind. Conversations happen proactively, before infrastructure is deployed. Assumptions are explicit and shown alongside every estimate. You understand costs when you can still change course.

This isn't about optimization or cost reduction. It's about understanding and conversation. It's about making informed decisions instead of hoping for the best.

## SECTION 4 — HOW IT WORKS (High Level)

### Headline
```
How it works
```

### Content

**1. Connect your Terraform**

Point us to your Terraform files. We read your infrastructure configuration—the resources you're planning to deploy, the regions you've chosen, the instance types you've specified.

**2. See an estimated monthly cost**

We use official cloud provider pricing APIs to calculate what your infrastructure will cost. The estimate shows a total monthly cost, broken down by service and resource.

**3. Understand what drives that cost**

See which services drive the most cost. Understand the assumptions behind each estimate—instance counts, usage patterns, pricing assumptions. Every cost item shows its confidence level: high, medium, or low.

**4. Explore scenarios safely**

What if you deploy to a different region? What if you change instance sizes? Compare scenarios side-by-side. See the cost difference. Make decisions with full information.

**5. Share and discuss**

Export estimates as CSV or PDF. Share read-only links with your team. Have cost conversations before deployment, not after.

## SECTION 5 — WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT (Trust Section)

### Headline
```
Built for understanding, not optimization
```

### Content

**Pre-bill timing**

We show costs *before* deployment, when decisions can still be changed. This isn't about tracking spending or reducing existing costs. It's about understanding costs during design.

**Explicit assumptions**

Every estimate shows its assumptions. Instance counts, usage patterns, pricing assumptions—they're all visible. You see confidence levels. You know what's certain and what's not. No false precision.

**Scenarios without pressure**

Compare design alternatives side-by-side. See cost differences. Explore "what if" scenarios. There's no pressure to optimize or reduce costs. Just understanding.

**Advisory insights, not commands**

AI-generated insights help you understand cost drivers and patterns. They're advisory, not prescriptive. They're grounded in your actual infrastructure, not generic advice.

---

### What This Is Not (Callout Box)

**This product is explicitly not:**

- **A cloud provider bill** — These are estimates based on assumptions, not actual usage
- **A cost optimization engine** — We don't recommend changes or calculate savings
- **A finance dashboard** — We don't track spending or enforce budgets
- **Real-time usage tracking** — We estimate from configuration, not monitor actual resources

Being clear about what we're not protects trust and sets correct expectations.

## SECTION 6 — WHO IT'S FOR (Clarity)

### Headline
```
For infrastructure teams who need cost clarity during design
```

### Content

This is for infrastructure engineers, platform teams, and architects who are:

- **Designing new infrastructure** from Terraform
- **Evaluating architecture changes** and their cost implications
- **Preparing cost estimates** for stakeholders
- **Comparing design alternatives** before committing

**When to use it:**

- Planning a new service or environment
- Considering region changes or multi-region deployments
- Evaluating scaling decisions (instance sizes, autoscaling)
- Reviewing architecture changes with cost implications
- Preparing budget estimates for new projects

**What you need:**

- Terraform configuration files (or access to a GitHub repository)
- A few minutes to connect and review estimates

### Final CTA

**Option 1 (Soft):**
```
See how it works with your Terraform
```

**Option 2 (Invitation):**
```

```

**Option 3 (Exploration):**
```

```

**Recommended:** Option 1 — Aligns with the calm, exploratory tone.
